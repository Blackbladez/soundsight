UniRPG Ed. version 1.4

UniRPG Ed. is an extension for the Unity3D editor which will help 
you to setup and draw tile-based maps for your game(s).

Please visit the Unity3D forum for more information and videos.
I've included a PDF documentation but recommend you also
watch the tutorial videos.

NOTE: Use the DLLs from "for_unity4.zip" if you are using Unity 4
See UniRPG_Ed_Doc.pdf for more info
